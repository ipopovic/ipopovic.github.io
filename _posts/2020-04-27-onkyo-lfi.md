Vendor: https://www.onkyousa.com/

Known Affected Versions:
TX-NR585 Firmware Version 1000-0000-000-0008-0000

### Description:
Within the Onkyo TX-NR585 Radio Reciever there is a local file inclusion vulnerability that can be exploited on the built in webserver(s) on the device. A weakly implemented filter can be bypassed with basic URL encoding techniques (%2e%2e%2f) to expose sensitive files on the system


## Steps to reproduce:

* Locate the Onkyo Reciever on your network 

* Access any of the web servers running on the device, several can be found by running a simple nmap scan:

```
root@pvris:~#nmap -sT -vvv 192.168.0.80
Reason: 993 no-responses
PORT      STATE SERVICE        REASON
80/tcp    open  http           syn-ack
5000/tcp  open  upnp           syn-ack
8008/tcp  open  http           syn-ack
8009/tcp  open  ajp13          syn-ack
8080/tcp  open  http-proxy     syn-ack
8888/tcp  open  sun-answerbook syn-ack
10001/tcp open  scp-config     syn-ack

```

In the above example, I tested 8080 for Local File Inclusion.

* Capture a HTTP Request to the reciever in Burpsuite and send it into Repeater with Control + R

* Modify the URL to %2e%2e%2f to traverse back a directory, creating several sets of these, we are able to hit the root of the file system, from there we can then attempt to disclose a sensitive file (such as /etc/shadow as seen in the screenshot below)

* Sucess, we have disclosed a sensitive file on the system. LFI has been achieved.

* For fun, now we have the password hashes out of /etc/shadow, lets try and crack it!

Loading the root password hash into hashcat, we are able to crack it relatively quickly, in about a minutes time:

Interesting, the cracked password is morimori, which is a Japanese word: もりもり. This actually makes a bit of sense seeing that Onkyo is a Japanese company.
