Version: 5.6 Build 04

Description: Z-Cron is a task scheduling software that enables Administrators and Users to schedule tasks on a system.
Exploit Details: Z-Cron tasks are shared globally throughout the system, enabling any user to open the software, modify a task (which is classified as Insecure Access Control), and have it executed. If the executable is stored in a publicly accessible location, all logged in users will have the task executed.

## Steps To Reproduce

- Create a scheduled task (In our instance, we're going to create the task as a privileged user)

- Ensure the task is being executed on some time of a schedule in the scheduler tab, for example, here we're going to create a task to execute every 5 minutes

- Ensure the credentials of the user you want the task to run as are implemented

- Ensure the task is saved, run a demo and make sure the task executes successfully

Above is a screenshot of the task being executed as well as the log files.

Now we're going to begin the exploitation portion -- An unprivileged user can modify the privileged users task

- First, create a payload, I'm going to use msfvenom to generate a Meterpreter payload and upload it to a remote share:

- Next we're going to put the payload in a publicly accessible location, and modify the task as a normal, different, unprivileged user:

- In the background we have exploit/multi/handler listening for the reverse shell to get executed on the 5 minute mark:

- Watch out for all the incoming shells. For every user that has been logged into the box, you'll recieve a shell:

This should be a lesson about access control and how powerful it is when any user can modify something that a privileged user has created.
